                <h2> Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <h3>Example: Best Buy</h3>
                <p class="visual-paragraph-1">Website:<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com">www.bestbuy.com</a></p>
                <img class="visual-img" src="/week2/images/bestbuywebsite.jpg" alt="Image of Bestbuy Mobile version">
                <p class="visual-paragraph-2">
                    I think Best Buy homepage does a good job of using the principle of 
                    visual hierarchy. The first thing you see is the latest technology 
                    on display. Best Buy is perhaps the biggest retailer in the United States
                    for electronics so keeping up with these is a number one technology 
                    and people visiting the site will be interested to find. Another aspect 
                    is their COVID statement as this pandemic has affected its stores so to 
                    wants to let everyone know what they are doing to combat but still meet their 
                    customer's needs.

                <h2> Hick's Law</h2>
                <h3>Example: American Eagle</h3>
                <p class="hicks-paragraph-1">Website:<a href="https://www.ae.com/us/en">www.ae.com</a></p>
                <img class="hicks-img" src="/week2/images/hicks.jpg" alt="Image of the American Eagle Website">
                <p class="hicks-paragraph-2">
                    American Eagle does a great job of using hicks law. Clothes are one of the things in life
                    people definitely will always take a long time to choose out. By being able to quickly navigate
                    to what you are looking for American Eagle's Website can help its customers find what to
                    wear fast. With many different paths to take whether you are looking for men's or women's clothes, jeans,
                    swimsuits. You can even further limit those by styles it makes finding what you are looking for a breeze.

                <h2> Fitt's Law</h2>
                <h3>Example: Royal Caribbean</h3>
                <p class="fitt-paragraph-1">Website:<a href="https://www.royalcaribbean.com/">www.royalcaribbean.com</a></p>
                <img class="fitt-img" src="/week2/images/royal.jpg" alt="Image of Royal Carribbean Mobile Website">
                <p class="fitt-paragraph-2">
                    Royal Caribbean is perhaps the most popular cruise line in the industry and its 
                    website is top-notch. Fitt's Law is all about letting the user being able to quickly interact with your 
                    website and the first thing you see is the bright orange "Book Now" right in the middle of the screen, it's 
                    very easy to get drawn into it and dream you are at these tropical locations. I think it also takes advantage of the visual Hierarchy 
                    as well but I think its placement has a lot to do with it as well.
